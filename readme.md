# Awesome Distributed System Projects

This repository contains list of distributed system projects with open source code in various programming languages which may be review in order to better understand how to distributed services.

## Databases

- [(Golang) Jocko - Kafka/distributed commit log service in Go. [Serf + Raft]](https://github.com/travisjeffery/jocko)
- [(Golang) oklog - distributed and co√∂rdination-free log management system for big ol' clusters [Archived]](https://github.com/oklog/oklog)
- [(Golang) Kingbus - a distributed MySQL binlog store based on raft [Raft]](https://github.com/flike/kingbus)
- [(Golang) elasticell - a distributed HA Redis-compatible NoSQL database with strong consistency and reliability](https://github.com/deepfabric/elasticell)

## Key-Value Storages

- [(Golang) etcd - distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system [Raft + gRPC]](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd)

## Streaming

- [(Python) faust - a distributed stream processing library that ports the ideas from Kafka Streams to Python](https://github.com/robinhood/faust)
- [(Golang) Liftbridge - lightweight, fault-tolerant message streams by implementing a durable stream augmentation for the NATS messaging system](https://github.com/liftbridge-io/liftbridge)

## Schedulers

- [(Golang) dkron - distributed, fault tolerant job scheduling system for cloud native environments](https://github.com/distribworks/dkron)

## Queues

- [(Golang) nsq - realtime fault tolerant distributed messaging platform designed to operate at scale, handling billions of messages per day [Raft + gRPC]](https://github.com/nsqio/nsq)
- [(Golang) Sandglass - distributed, horizontally scalable, persistent, time ordered message queue](https://github.com/sandglass/sandglass)
- [(Golang) dnpipes -  distributed version of Unix named pipes comparable to AWS SQS](https://github.com/mhausenblas/dnpipes)

## FileSystems

- [(Golang) JuiceFS - a Hadoop-compatible AWS S3-compatible high-performance POSIX file system](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs)

## Frameworks

- [(Golang) etcd - framework for distributed systems development](https://github.com/asim/go-micro). Provides the core requirements for distributed systems development including RPC and Event driven communication
- [(Golang) ergo - port of Erlang/OTP approaches in Golang](https://github.com/halturin/ergo)
- [(Golang) gosiris - an actor framework for Golang](https://github.com/teivah/gosiris)

## Components

- [(Golang) Dragonboat - a high performance multi-group Raft consensus library in pure Go](https://github.com/lni/dragonboat)
- [(Golang) Golimit - Uber ringpop based distributed and decentralized rate limiter](https://github.com/myntra/golimit)
